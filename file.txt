[1,2,3,4,5]
start =0 
end 4
target 6


1midle=3

is 3===6 n0
is 3>6 no
is 3<6 yess so start= 2 and end 4

find the midd again 2+4/2=3

is array[3]>target no
is array[3]===target no
is array[3]<target yess so start=start ===4 end ===4
                           start =5        end 4

this means if the start is greater than the end the number is not found in the list
